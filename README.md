### Working with Rules

Before you start writing a new rule, please read [the official ESLint guide](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules).

Next, in order to get an idea how does the AST of the code that you want to check looks like, use one of the following applications:
- [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net/) - the best tool to inspect ASTs

To know more about certain nodes in produced ASTs, go here:
- [ESTree docs](https://github.com/estree/estree)

Check out [an example rule](https://github.com/youssefsharief/d3-data-vis-eslint-plugin/blob/master/rules/no-pie.js) to get a better understanding of how these work.

Please be aware that regarding what kind of code examples you'll write in tests, you'll have to accordingly set up the parser in `RuleTester` (you can do it on a per test case basis). See an example [here](https://github.com/youssefsharief/d3-data-vis-eslint-plugin/blob/master/tests/no-pie.js).

If you'll stuck, remember there are plenty of rules you can learn from already. If you can't find the right solution, don't hesitate to reach out in [issues](https://github.com/youssefsharief/d3-data-vis-eslint-plugin/issues) â€“ we're happy to help!
